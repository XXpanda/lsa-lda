= Compile =
Source code contains two program: lda and topword. lda program do parameter estimation & inference, and topword program output the top words of each topic.
1. Compile lda: 
make clean
make
2. Compile topword:
make topword
= Parameter estimation =
Command : $> ./lda [topic num] [sample num] [data] [model name]
* topic num: the number of topics
* sample num: after gibbs sampling burn in period, we sample [sample num] times and calculate their average value.
* data: path of the data
* model name: model's name. output file will be named by <model_name>.<type>
Note that alpha and beta are set as 50/K and 0.1 as default.
= Input Data Formation=
Input data of this program is the same as blei's C code of LDA Here[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/] :
[M] [term_1]:[count] [term_2]:[count] ...  [term_N]:[count]
[M] is the number of unique terms in the document
[count] associated with each term is how many times that term appeared in the document.  
Note that [term_1] is an integer which indexes the term; it is not a string.
