= Compile =
Source code contains two program: lda and topword. lda program do parameter estimation & inference, and topword program outputs the top words of each topic.<br>
1. Compile lda: <br>
make clean<br>
make<br>
2. Compile topword:<br>
make topword<br>
= Parameter estimation =
Command : $> ./lda |topic num| |sample num| |data| |model name|<br>
* topic num: the number of topics<br>
* sample num: after gibbs sampling burn in period, we sample [sample num] times and calculate their average value.<br>
* data: path of the data<br>
* model name: model's name. output file will be named by <model_name>.<type><br>
Note that alpha and beta are set as 50/K and 0.1 as default.
= Input Data Formation=
Input data of this program is the same as blei's C code of LDA [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/ Here]
|M| |term_1|:|count| |term_2|:|count| ...  |term_N|:|count|
[M] is the number of unique terms in the document
|count| associated with each term is how many times that term appeared in the document.  
Note that |term_1| is an integer which indexes the term; it is not a string.
